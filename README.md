## 📡 Live vs. Monitored Processes

PM2-Hawkeye has two modes for each process.

**Live only (default)**

When you open a process without enabling monitoring, you see real-time CPU, memory, and a live log stream. None of this is saved. Navigating away or closing the tab loses the history - when you return you start fresh.

**Monitored**

Click *Start Monitoring* on any process to enable persistent tracking. PM2-Hawkeye will:

- Sample CPU and memory every 20 seconds and store the history (default: 24 hours)
- Persist incoming log lines to the database (default: 14 days)
- Show a sparkline chart of CPU and memory over time
- Backfill the last log entries from the PM2 log files on first enable

Monitoring state survives server restarts. You can stop monitoring at any time - this removes all stored history for that process.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher
- PM2 installed globally (`npm i -g pm2`)
- At least one PM2 process running

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orangecoding/pm2-hawkeye.git
cd pm2-hawkeye
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure

Copy the example env file and open it in your editor:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a password hash and paste the output into `.env`:

```bash
node -e "
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
  const hash = crypto.scryptSync('YOUR_PASSWORD', Buffer.from(salt,'hex'), 64).toString('hex');
  console.log('AUTH_PASSWORD_SALT=' + salt);
  console.log('AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH=' + hash);
"
```

### 3. Build & run

```bash
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3030** in your browser.

### 4. Run as a PM2 process (recommended)

The recommended production setup is to run PM2-Hawkeye as a PM2 process itself so it is supervised and auto-restarted:

```bash
npm run build
pm2 start lib/transport/server.js --name pm2-hawkeye
pm2 save
```

---

## 🔄 Updating

`update.sh` handles the full update cycle for a self-hosted installation:

```bash
./update.sh
```

It will:

1. Pull the latest commits from upstream (fast-forward only - aborts if there are local changes)
2. Install or update Node.js dependencies
3. Rebuild the frontend bundle
4. Restart the `pm2-hawkeye` process under PM2 (if running)

Make the script executable once before first use:

```bash
chmod +x update.sh
```

If PM2-Hawkeye is not running under PM2 when the script finishes, it will print the commands to start it manually.

> [!NOTE]
> **Database location** — by default the database is written to `./data/pm2-hawkeye.db` inside the project directory. If you update by replacing the project folder (e.g. re-cloning), this file will be lost. Point `SQLITE_DB_PATH` at a directory outside the project to keep your data safe across updates (`pm2-hawkeye.db` is created inside it automatically):
> ```bash
> SQLITE_DB_PATH=/var/lib/pm2-hawkeye
> ```
> Create the directory first: `mkdir -p /var/lib/pm2-hawkeye`

> [!NOTE]
> **PM2 timestamps** — PM2-Hawkeye merges stdout and stderr and sorts log lines chronologically. This requires PM2 to prefix each line with a timestamp. Always start your processes with `--time`:
> ```bash
> pm2 start app.js --name my-app --time
> ```
> Without it, log lines from stdout and stderr cannot be sorted correctly.

## ⚡ Custom Actions with tx2

PM2-Hawkeye can display and trigger custom actions that your app exposes to PM2 via **[tx2](https://github.com/pm2/tx2)**.

### Install tx2

```bash
npm install tx2
```

### Define actions in your app

```js
import tx2 from 'tx2';

// Simple action
tx2.action('clear cache', (done) => {
  myCache.flush();
  done({ success: true });
});

// Action with a parameter
tx2.action('set log level', (level, done) => {
  logger.setLevel(level);
  done({ level });
});
```

`done()` must always be called - it signals to PM2 that the action has completed and sends the return value back to the dashboard.

### Trigger from PM2-Hawkeye

Once your process is running, open it in PM2-Hawkeye. Any registered actions appear as buttons in the **Actions** panel.

**Available tx2 APIs**

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tx2.action(name, fn)` | Register a triggerable action |
| `tx2.action(name, { arity: 1 }, fn)` | Action that accepts a parameter |
| `tx2.metric(name, fn)` | Expose a live metric |
| `tx2.counter(name)` | Incrementing counter |
| `tx2.histogram(name)` | Value distribution histogram |

---

## Development

PM2-Hawkeye uses a two-process dev setup: the Node.js backend runs on port 3030 and an esbuild dev server handles the frontend on port 3042 with instant rebuilds and hot module replacement.

### Start the backend

```bash
node --inspect lib/transport/server.js
```

### Start the frontend dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3042**. The dev server proxies all `/api/*`, `/ws/*`, and HTML routes through to the backend.

### Tests, lint, format

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm run format        # write
npm run format:check  # check only
```

## 🔔 Alerting

PM2-Hawkeye can send you a notification whenever a monitored process logs something that matches your configured severity threshold - for example, every time an error is written to stderr.

### How it works

Log lines captured from your PM2 processes flow through a detection pipeline:

1. **Level detection** - each line is inspected for a severity prefix (`ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`). Lines arriving on stderr that carry no detectable prefix are automatically treated as `error`.
2. **Threshold check** - the detected level is compared against the set of levels you selected in Settings. If the level is not in the set, the line is silently discarded.
3. **Per-process mute check** - if you have muted a specific process via the megaphone icon (📢) in the sidebar, alerts for that process are skipped.
4. **Throttle check** - in *throttle* mode a second alert for the same process is suppressed until the configured cool-down window has elapsed. In *every match* mode all qualifying lines trigger a notification.
5. **Dispatch** - all enabled reporters are called concurrently. A failure in one reporter does not block the others.

### Settings UI

Click the **Settings** button in the sidebar toolbar to open the settings overlay.

- **General** - edit raw `.env` key/value pairs and change your login password. Changes are written to disk; a restart of PM2-Hawkeye is required for them to take effect.
- **Alerting** - configure the alert mode, log level thresholds, and reporters.

### Reporters

#### Webhook

Sends an HTTP POST request to any URL you choose. You can attach custom request headers and build a fully custom JSON body using key/value pairs with template variables:

| Variable | Replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{logLevel}` | Detected log level (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`) |
| `{log_message}` | The full log line text |
| `{process_name}` | The PM2 process name |

Variable substitution is JSON-aware: if a value contains `{log_message}` inside a quoted JSON string it is substituted as a raw string; if it appears as an unquoted JSON value the substituted text is JSON-encoded automatically, preventing malformed payloads.

A live curl preview updates in real time as you fill in the form so you can verify the exact request before saving.

#### ntfy

Sends a push notification to an [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) topic. Configure the server URL, topic, message priority, and an optional auth token. PM2-Hawkeye sets the `Title`, `Priority`, and `Tags` headers automatically.

### Per-process mute

Every monitored process shows a megaphone icon (📢) in the sidebar. Click it to mute alerts for that process - the icon dims to indicate the muted state. Click again to re-enable. The preference is stored in the database and survives restarts.

## Security

- **CSRF tokens** - one-time-use tokens rotated after every state-changing request
- **Rate limiting** - sliding window + exponential backoff on failed logins; separate rate limit for unauthenticated access
- **CSP headers** - strict Content-Security-Policy including `ws:`/`wss:` for WebSockets
- **Timing-attack mitigation** - constant-time credential comparison with a minimum response delay
- **Secure cookies** - `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, optional `Secure` flag
